# Skill Creator

This skill provides guidance for creating effective skills.

## Anatomy of a Skill

Every skill consists of a required SKILL.md file and optional bundled resources:

```
skill-name/
├── SKILL.md (required)
│   ├── YAML frontmatter metadata (required)
│   │   ├── name: (required)
│   │   └── description: (required)
│   └── Markdown instructions (required)
└── Bundled Resources (optional)
    ├── scripts/          - Executable code
    ├── references/       - Documentation
    └── assets/           - Templates, assets
```

## Best Practices
- Keep SKILL.md body to the essentials.
- Use imperative/infinitive form.
- Define clear name and description in frontmatter.
