# Light Agent

Lightweight AI Agent designed for local execution, portability, and everyday tasks.

## Usage

Start a chat with the agent:
```bash
uv run lightagent chat
```

Or run a single prompt:
```bash
uv run lightagent chat "Sua pergunta aqui"
```

Use verbose mode for detailed logs:
```bash
uv run lightagent chat "Sua pergunta aqui" --verbose
```

### Slash Commands
Inside the interactive chat mode, you can use the following commands:
- `/new`: Clear current conversation history and start fresh.
- `/status`: Show connected MCP servers and loaded markdown skills.
- `/reset`: Restart tools and reconnect to MCP servers.
- `/quit` or `/exit`: Close the session.

## Core Features
Supported via `litellm`:
- **Ollama**: Local execution (llama3, mistral).
- **Google Gemini**: Remote high-reasoning tasks.
- **LLMStudy**: Custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints.

### 2. Tools & Skills
- **Native Tools**: `exec`, `list_dir`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `web_search`, `web_fetch`.
- **Markdown Skills**: Discovered in `light_agent/base/skills/` (fallback to `workspace/skills/`).
- **Sub-agents**: Task delegation via `spawn`, `parallel_spawn`, and result coordination via `wait_subagents`.
- **CodeSearch Skill**: Production patterns from open source repos (`workspace/skills/codesearch/`)
- **Librarian Agent**: External documentation research specialist (`workspace/agents/librarian.md`)

### 3. MCP Integrations
Connect to external Model Context Protocol servers (e.g., Google Drive, Slack) by configuring `light_agent/base/servers_config.json` (or `workspace/servers_config.json`).

### 4. Structured Memory
- **Long-term Memory (SQLite)**: Stores full interaction history in `data/memory/long_memory.db`. Uses BM25 for semantic search.
- **Fixed Facts (MEMORY.md)**: Stores immutable user facts (e.g., preferences, tech stack) in `light_agent/base/memory/MEMORY.md` (or `workspace/memory/MEMORY.md`).
- **Auto-Summary**: Portuguese summaries generated by the LLM for every Q&A.
- **Tool Observations**: Automatically captures insights from tool executions (read_file, exec, grep, etc.) as searchable observations.

## Roadmap & Future Issues

| Feature | Category | Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Long-term Memory** | Memory | ✅ Done | Persistent storage using SQLite + BM25 with time-based filtering (e.g., last 30d). |
| **Tool Observations** | Memory | ✅ Done | Auto-capture insights from tool executions as searchable observations. |
| **Parallel Subagents** | Agents | ✅ Done | Enable multiple subagents to work concurrently on complex tasks. |
| **Multi-Model Orchestration** | LLM | ✅ Done | Use different models for reasoning (main loop) vs. speed (summaries). |
| **Interactive Chat Mode** | CLI | ✅ Done | Persistent chat session launched via `uv run lightagent chat`. |
| **Slash Commands** | CLI | ✅ Done | Support for commands like `/new`, `/reset`, and `/status` within the chat. |
| **Security Hardening** | Security | ✅ Done | Shell command allowlist, SSRF protection, workspace restriction. |
| **Human Approval Tool** | 12-Factor | ✅ Done | Pause execution for human approval before high-stakes operations. |
| **Control Flow Hooks** | 12-Factor | ✅ Done | Intercept agent execution at strategic points (before/after tool, LLM calls). |
| **Reducer Pattern** | 12-Factor | ✅ Done | Immutable state transitions for predictable, testable agent behavior. |

## Security Features

Light Agent includes enterprise-grade security controls:

| **Shell Command Safety** | Command allowlist, injection protection, and subprocess isolation. |
| **SSRF Protection** | Blocks private IPs and cloud metadata endpoints. |
| **Workspace Security** | File operations confined to workspace directory. |

Configure in `.env`:
```env
RESTRICT_TO_WORKSPACE=true  # Default: true
```
